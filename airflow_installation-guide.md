# Airflow Installation - Commands
## Linux (or WSL)
#### Update sudo apt
In the home directory of Linux terminal (or after installation WSL on your Windows)

```sh

#### Installation of necessary tools on terminal (or WSL)

```sh
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv

```sh
python3 -m venv airflow_venv
```

### AIRFLOW_HOME setup (terminal or WSL)
Make a directory where you want to save your project. 
```sh
cd
mkdir airflow_project
```
Create #### $AIRFLOW_HOME to avoid dependency.
```sh
vim ~/.bashrc
```
perss i then export your airflow_project folder path.

```sh
export AIRFLOW_HOME=/mnt/your_driver/your_folder
for example: /mnt/e/airflow_project
```
[```airflow_project``` should be in ```e``` drive.]

Now press ```esc``` button for save and then type ```:wq``` for exit from bashrc.

After this a bashrc should be reloaded with ```source ~/.bashrc ```. 
To check if the value is properly set: ```echo $AIRFLOW_HOME``` and it should print the path you provided earlier.



### Apache Airflow Installation
Make sure ```airflow_venv``` are active and you are in ```$AIRFLOW_HOME``` path and  then install Apache Airflow with
```sh
cd
source airflow_venv/bin/activate
cd $AIRFLOW_HOME
pip install apache-airflow
```
